# Gender and Age Detector
 A DL based detector that estimates gender and age from images of faces. Includes a GUI where one can upload images. 

Note: Tensorflow does not work for Python versions after 3.11. To work around this issue, use a virtual environment with Python version 3.11 to do the coding required for this project.
